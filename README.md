Welcome to ChessPrep! ChessPrep is a site that allows chess players to build and practice their opening repertoire.

After you create an account, ChessPrep will show you positions and ask you to enter your move of choice for those positions. To help you decide, a list of the most popular moves from that position will be shown based on a database of over a million master level games.

After you choose your moves, you will be drilled on those moves using a method called spaced repetition. The more times you play the right move, the less often you will be asked to repeat that move.

As you practice your moves, ChessPrep will calculate the most likely positions you are to face based on your previously entered moves. When you no longer have moves to practice, ChessPrep will show you the next most likely position and ask you for a new move. This lets you prioritize and focus on only the most relevant positions and enables you to have a well balanced opening repertoire.
